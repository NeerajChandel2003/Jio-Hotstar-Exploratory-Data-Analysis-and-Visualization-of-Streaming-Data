# Jio-Hotstar-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-of-Streaming-Data
A data analytics and machine learning project on JioHotstar, formed after the JioCinema–Disney+ Hotstar merger (Feb 2025). Using synthetic data, Python, Plotly Dash, and Random Forest, the project analyzes user behavior, content trends, and predicts subscription levels.

The main aim of this project is to research, visualize and forecast different factors of the user activity in JioHotstar.
We use synthetic data that describes the demographics of the user, the metadata of the content and the viewing patterns to determine the most popular genres, languages and pattern of subscription among the audiences in India.
Python libraries used in the project are Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn that were used in data analysis and machine learning.
A dashboard constructed with Plotly Dash enables the real-time visual information of decision-makers.
The predictive modeling with the help of the Random Forest Classifier is also included in the study, in order to predict the subscription levels in connection with viewing behavior and ratings.
This report shows how streaming platforms can utilize data analytics to know more about users, enhance engagement, and make strategic content choices.
